The best thing is to do our code challenge below and impress us: )

Looking forward to your answer!

Create a web app written in Node.JS using an Express based framework, SequelizeJS, and MySQL.

Use NPM to declare all dependencies so that we can run it in a test environment.

The app should allow an admin to enter survey questions with multiple choice answers.

When a guest visits the app in a browser it should present a random survey question to the guest and allow them to answer.

Record answers and display the survey results in an admin interface.

Avoid showing a previously answered question to the same guest.

Make sure the UI is mobile browser friendly.

Provide a clear README with instructions on how to setup and run the app.

Create a github.com repository with the app that we can pull from and test.
